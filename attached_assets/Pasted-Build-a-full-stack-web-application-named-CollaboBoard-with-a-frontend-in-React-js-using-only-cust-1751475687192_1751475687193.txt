Build a full-stack web application named "CollaboBoard" with a frontend in React.js (using only custom CSS, no UI libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind) and a backend in Node.js with Express.js. Use MongoDB as the database via Mongoose. The app must support secure user registration and login using JWT authentication with bcrypt-hashed passwords. Each task should include a unique title (per board, and not equal to "Todo", "In Progress", or "Done"), description, status (Todo, In Progress, Done), priority, assigned user, and a lastEdited timestamp. Enable full task CRUD operations. Implement real-time updates using Socket.IO so that when any user adds, edits, deletes, reassigns, or drag-drops a task, all users see the update immediately. Log all actions (who did what, and when) into MongoDB and expose a REST API to fetch the latest 20 logs. Also, display these logs live on the frontend. Include a "Smart Assign" button on each task that assigns the task to the user with the fewest current active tasks (status: Todo or In Progress), and sync this action live across users. Implement conflict handling by comparing the lastEdited timestamp when a user tries to save changesâ€”if different, show both versions and let the user choose to merge or overwrite. Use React DnD or HTML5 drag-drop to move tasks between the 3 Kanban columns. Add at least one custom animation (like card flip or smooth drag-drop). The entire UI must be responsive for mobile and desktop. Structure the project with two folders: /client for the React frontend and /server for the Express backend. Do not use any monolithic setup or combine frontend and backend. Each folder must have its own package.json, .env, and .env.example. For development, use this exact MongoDB URI in the backend .env: MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://mathanl1434:mathan1434@cluster0.e1b2fvr.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0. The frontend must be deployable to Vercel or Netlify and the backend must be deployable to Render, Railway, or Cyclic. You must not skip, change, or use alternatives for any feature, styling, or logic. Only implement exactly what is described here and nothing else.
